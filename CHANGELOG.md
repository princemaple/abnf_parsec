## v2.0.0 - 2025-03-05

### Highlights 🎉

- Core rules are no longer special-cased, they are brought in via parsing and compiling `core.abnf`
  - hence they can now be transformed, ignored, just like other rules
- Core rules are now all transformed to string format by default
  - so when matching `*HEXDIG` on `"1A"`, instead of getting `[49, 65]`, you get `["1", "A"]`
  - however, performing `List.to_string` on either one gives you the same result - `"1A"`
- Core rules are defined only when they are not already defined in your abnf
  - if they are already defined in your abnf, they will be skipped
  - note the way we generate the functions unifies cases, so if you have `char` defined,
    the core rule `CHAR` will be ignored as well
  - this also makes it possible to override core rules
